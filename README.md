### Hey hey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a senior developer marketing manager and web developer working at Contentful building fun projects along the way. My skills lean heavily on the frontend side of things but I love learning new tools and ways of programming better. I've built out a porfolio of work [Stahlwalker](https://stahlwalker.org/) if you care to learn more about what I'm building. 

On a personal side, I'm a husband, proud father, dog lover and a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan for those sports enthusiasts out there.

My most recent project is a Next.js app built using Contentful's content management platform and it's a Star Wars themed cookbook, check it out if you are hungry and enjoy.
