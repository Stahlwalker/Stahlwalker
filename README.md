### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a senior developer marketing manager and web developer working in the tech industry. I have 16+ years of marketing experience and recently obtained a Masterâ€™s degree in Communications: New Media and Marketing at Southern New Hampshire University. Following my MA degree I completed a Full Stack Web Development Certificate at Northwestern University, in order to build on my digital skillset.

I have a passion for videography and photography. Iâ€™m looking to use my passion and experience, along with my education to further my digital marketing career.
